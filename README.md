## Hi, I would like to represent you Snake in 3 languages (C++, Python, Java)
### That is my first project and I would like to check with language is better for this kind of program.


So, first project 'Snake in C++' done, but in terminal it is very slow.
I need to work on dynamic memory and maybe find another engine to run project.
